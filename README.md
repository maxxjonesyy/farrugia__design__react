## About

An interior design Website i made for a family member, I'm reasonably happy with it, it's just missing some more of the project photos for the portfolio section at this stage... Everything else is functional.

About 95% of this website was actually built before the ecommerce one i recently uploaded to Github, so i have learnt a thing or two since this project was started.

## Technologies

HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Material UI, React Router DOM, SweetAlert, EmailJS, SlickCarousel

If you take the time to have a read through the code and have some constructive criticism feel free to send it my way!

Some snaps of the Website, a link to the hosted site is in the description.
